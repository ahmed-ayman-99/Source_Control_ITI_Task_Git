# Source Control (Git) ITI Task

This repository serves as a practical assignment for **Source Control Management (Git)**, completed during my training at **ITI (Information Technology Institute)**.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this task was to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in fundamental Git commands and workflows, essential for collaborative development and version control.

This repository specifically showcases:
* **Git Basics:** Committing changes, tracking file history.
* **Branching & Merging**
* **Conflict Resolution**.
* **Collaboration Simulation**

## Files in this Repository

* **`Git-task2.py`**:
    * This Python script represents the core codebase for this assignment.
    * It contains for example a `Person` class with methods like `__init__`, `sleep`, `eat`, and `buy`, simulating basic character actions and status changes (mood, healthrate, money).
    * This file was the subject of version control operations (commits, branches, merges) throughout the task.
* **`Task.pdf`**:
    * This PDF file describes the exact steps and work performed for this task.
